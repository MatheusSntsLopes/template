## Description

That's a simple solution to start APIs in nodejs if you don't want to download all dependencies every time when you start some new project. 

You can implement any architecture on this template and it already comes with prettier, jest, eslint, docker and suport for circleci if you wanna implement CI/CD in that platform.
